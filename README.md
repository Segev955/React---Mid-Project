# React Mid Project

## üìå Project Overview  
This React project is a client-side database management application that interacts with server data from the following sources:  

- [Users API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)  
- [Posts API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)  
- [Todos API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos)  

The application initializes data from these APIs and allows users to **search, update, delete, and manage** users, todos, and posts.
